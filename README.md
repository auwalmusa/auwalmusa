# 👋 Hi, I'm Auwal Musa

I am a **research scientist** and **data analyst** passionate about transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. My expertise spans from **machine learning** and **data visualisation** to environmental monitoring and electrochemical sensor development. I’ve led various data-driven projects on environmental science, helping organizations make informed decisions through accurate and reliable data models.

In my professional journey, I’ve developed predictive models, including algorithms for **customer churn prediction** and **sales forecasting**, leveraging **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**. In addition to my work in data science, I have applied advanced material chemistry techniques in electrochemical sensor development, integrating both scientific research and data analytics.

Throughout my academic and professional career, I’ve been dedicated to teaching and mentoring students, particularly in **data analysis** and environmental monitoring.
